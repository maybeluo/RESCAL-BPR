# RESCAL-BPR
RESCAL is a famous relational learning method for knowledge graph completition, knowledge inference, etc.

The initial way of optimize RESCAL is ALS, by taking the missing data as false, which is not very convincing.

This code implements the optimization of RESCAL under the framework of Bayesian Personalize Ranking (BPR).
